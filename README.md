### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Fadhlan, I'm a passionate mobile developer with a focus on Flutter, dedicated to mobile app development. Eager to expand my skills, currently exploring Swift. I've been part of several projects, working with a variety of libraries to create innovative solutions.

Here are a couple of projects that I've been a part of:
